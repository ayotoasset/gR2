Description: This R package contains functions to compute the supervised and unsupervised 
    sample generalized R square measures. It also includes the K-lines clustering algorithm 
    and a function to choose K for the unsupervised case. Functions for statistical inference 
    of the supervised and unsupervised population generalied R square measures are also provided.
