Description: This R package contains a function to compute the supervised and unsupervised 
    sample generalized R square measures. The function also implements the K-lines clustering algorithm 
    and allows an automatic choice of K for the unsupervised case. Statistical inference 
    of the supervised and unsupervised population generalied R square measures is also included.
